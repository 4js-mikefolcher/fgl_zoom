Intended to be compatible with versions of Genero 3.10 and above.  The use of 
dynamic dialogs will make it difficult to port to versions prior to 3.0.

Tested against SQLite database, in theory should work against other database
types but haven't added these to test plan as yet.
(was originally tested against Informix so should still work against this)
